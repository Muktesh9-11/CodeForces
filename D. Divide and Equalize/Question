D. Divide and Equalize

2 seconds256 megabytesstandard inputstandard output
You are given an array 𝑎
 consisting of 𝑛
 positive integers. You can perform the following operation on it:

Choose a pair of elements 𝑎𝑖
 and 𝑎𝑗
 (1≤𝑖,𝑗≤𝑛
 and 𝑖≠𝑗
);
Choose one of the divisors of the integer 𝑎𝑖
, i.e., an integer 𝑥
 such that 𝑎𝑖mod𝑥=0
;
Replace 𝑎𝑖
 with 𝑎𝑖𝑥
 and 𝑎𝑗
 with 𝑎𝑗⋅𝑥
.
Determine whether it is possible to make all elements in the array the same by applying the operation a certain number of times (possibly zero).
For example, let's consider the array 𝑎
 = [100,2,50,10,1
] with 5
 elements. Perform two operations on it:

Choose 𝑎3=50
 and 𝑎2=2
, 𝑥=5
. Replace 𝑎3
 with 𝑎3𝑥=505=10
, and 𝑎2
 with 𝑎2⋅𝑥=2⋅5=10
. The resulting array is 𝑎
 = [100,10,10,10,1
];
Choose 𝑎1=100
 and 𝑎5=1
, 𝑥=10
. Replace 𝑎1
 with 𝑎1𝑥=10010=10
, and 𝑎5
 with 𝑎5⋅𝑥=1⋅10=10
. The resulting array is 𝑎
 = [10,10,10,10,10
].
After performing these operations, all elements in the array 𝑎
 become equal to 10
.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer 𝑡
 (1≤𝑡≤2000
) — the number of test cases.

Then follows the description of each test case.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer 𝑛
 (1≤𝑛≤104
) — the number of elements in the array 𝑎
.

The second line of each test case contains exactly 𝑛
 integers 𝑎𝑖
 (1≤𝑎𝑖≤106
) — the elements of the array 𝑎
.

It is guaranteed that the sum of 𝑛
 over all test cases does not exceed 104
.

Output
For each test case, output a single line:

"YES" if it is possible to make all elements in the array equal by applying the operation a certain (possibly zero) number of times;
"NO" otherwise.
You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will all be recognized as a positive answer).
