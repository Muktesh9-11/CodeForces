You are given an array 𝑎 consisting of 𝑛 nonnegative integers.

Let's define the prefix OR array 𝑏 as the array 𝑏𝑖=𝑎1 𝖮𝖱 𝑎2 𝖮𝖱 … 𝖮𝖱 𝑎𝑖, where 𝖮𝖱 represents the bitwise OR operation. In other words, the array 𝑏 is formed by computing the 𝖮𝖱 of every prefix of 𝑎.

You are asked to rearrange the elements of the array 𝑎 in such a way that its prefix OR array is lexicographically maximum.

An array 𝑥 is lexicographically greater than an array 𝑦 if in the first position where 𝑥 and 𝑦 differ, 𝑥𝑖>𝑦𝑖.

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤100) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer 𝑛 (1≤𝑛≤2⋅105) — the length of the array 𝑎.

The second line of each test case contains 𝑛 nonnegative integers 𝑎1,…,𝑎𝑛 (0≤𝑎𝑖≤109).

It is guaranteed that the sum of 𝑛 over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.

Output
For each test case print 𝑛 integers — any rearrangement of the array 𝑎 that obtains the lexicographically maximum prefix OR array.
