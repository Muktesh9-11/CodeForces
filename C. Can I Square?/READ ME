1 second256 megabytesstandard inputstandard output


Calin has 𝑛
 buckets, the 𝑖
-th of which contains 𝑎𝑖
 wooden squares of side length 1
.

Can Calin build a square using all the given squares?

Input
The first line contains a single integer 𝑡
 (1≤𝑡≤104
) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer 𝑛
 (1≤𝑛≤2⋅105
) — the number of buckets.

The second line of each test case contains 𝑛
 integers 𝑎1,…,𝑎𝑛
 (1≤𝑎𝑖≤109
) — the number of squares in each bucket.

The sum of 𝑛
 over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105
.

Output
For each test case, output "YES" if Calin can build a square using all of the given 1×1
 squares, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note
In the first test case, Calin can build a 3×3
 square.

In the second test case, Calin can build a 4×4
 square.

In the third test case, Calin cannot build a square using all the given squares.
