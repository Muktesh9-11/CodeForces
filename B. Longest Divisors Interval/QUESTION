B. Longest Divisors Interval

2 seconds256 megabytesstandard inputstandard output
Given a positive integer n, find the maximum size of an interval [l,r] of positive integers such that, for every i in the interval (i.e., l≤i≤r), n is a multiple of i.

Given two integers l≤r, the size of the interval [l,r] is r−l+1 (i.e., it coincides with the number of integers belonging to the interval).

Input
The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.

The only line of the description of each test case contains one integer n (1≤n≤1018).

Output
For each test case, print a single integer: the maximum size of a valid interval.

Note
In the first test case, a valid interval with maximum size is [1,1] (it's valid because n=1 is a multiple of 1) and its size is 1.

In the second test case, a valid interval with maximum size is [4,5] (it's valid because n=40 is a multiple of 4 and 5) and its size is 2.

In the third test case, a valid interval with maximum size is [9,11].

In the fourth test case, a valid interval with maximum size is [8,13].

In the seventh test case, a valid interval with maximum size is [327869,327871].
