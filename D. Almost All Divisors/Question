D. Almost All Divisors

2 seconds256 megabytesstandard inputstandard output
We guessed some integer number 𝑥
. You are given a list of almost all its divisors. Almost all means that there are all divisors except 1
 and 𝑥
 in the list.

Your task is to find the minimum possible integer 𝑥
 that can be the guessed number, or say that the input data is contradictory and it is impossible to find such number.

You have to answer 𝑡
 independent queries.

Input
The first line of the input contains one integer 𝑡
 (1≤𝑡≤25
) — the number of queries. Then 𝑡
 queries follow.

The first line of the query contains one integer 𝑛
 (1≤𝑛≤300
) — the number of divisors in the list.

The second line of the query contains 𝑛
 integers 𝑑1,𝑑2,…,𝑑𝑛
 (2≤𝑑𝑖≤106
), where 𝑑𝑖
 is the 𝑖
-th divisor of the guessed number. It is guaranteed that all values 𝑑𝑖
 are distinct.

Output
For each query print the answer to it.

If the input data in the query is contradictory and it is impossible to find such number 𝑥
 that the given list of divisors is the list of almost all its divisors, print -1. Otherwise print the minimum possible 𝑥
.
