Given an integer 𝑛.

Consider all pairs of integer arrays 𝑎 and 𝑝 of the same length such that 𝑛=∏𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑖 (i.e. 𝑎𝑝11⋅𝑎𝑝22⋅…) (𝑎𝑖>1;𝑝𝑖>0) and 𝑎𝑖 is the product of some (possibly one) distinct prime numbers.

For example, for 𝑛=28=22⋅71=41⋅71 the array pair 𝑎=[2,7], 𝑝=[2,1] is correct, but the pair of arrays 𝑎=[4,7], 𝑝=[1,1] is not, because 4=22 is a product of non-distinct prime numbers.

Your task is to find the maximum value of ∑𝑎𝑖⋅𝑝𝑖 (i.e. 𝑎1⋅𝑝1+𝑎2⋅𝑝2+…) over all possible pairs of arrays 𝑎 and 𝑝. Note that you do not need to minimize or maximize the length of the arrays.

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤1000) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains only one integer 𝑛 (2≤𝑛≤109).

Output
For each test case, print the maximum value of ∑𝑎𝑖⋅𝑝𝑖.

Note
In the first test case, 100=102 so that 𝑎=[10], 𝑝=[2] when ∑𝑎𝑖⋅𝑝𝑖 hits the maximum value 10⋅2=20. Also, 𝑎=[100], 𝑝=[1] does not work since 100 is not made of distinct prime factors.

In the second test case, we can consider 10 as 101, so 𝑎=[10], 𝑝=[1]. Notice that when 10=21⋅51, ∑𝑎𝑖⋅𝑝𝑖=7.
