C. Powers Of Two

4 seconds256 megabytesstandard inputstandard output
A positive integer 𝑥
 is called a power of two if it can be represented as 𝑥=2𝑦
, where 𝑦
 is a non-negative integer. So, the powers of two are 1,2,4,8,16,…
.

You are given two positive integers 𝑛
 and 𝑘
. Your task is to represent 𝑛
 as the sum of exactly 𝑘
 powers of two.

Input
The only line of the input contains two integers 𝑛
 and 𝑘
 (1≤𝑛≤109
, 1≤𝑘≤2⋅105
).

Output
If it is impossible to represent 𝑛
 as the sum of 𝑘
 powers of two, print NO.

Otherwise, print YES, and then print 𝑘
 positive integers 𝑏1,𝑏2,…,𝑏𝑘
 such that each of 𝑏𝑖
 is a power of two, and ∑𝑖=1𝑘𝑏𝑖=𝑛
. If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.
